## About me

I am currently a graduate student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) and my advisor is [Prof. Milind Kulkarni](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/).

My interests lie in the broad areas of Distributed and Parallel Programming Frameworks, Programming Languages, and Scientific Computing. Specifically, I am interested in automating the creation of, and optimizing distributed implementations of irregular algorithms. Examples of such algorithms are: finding nearest neighbors, mining frequent items in a transaction set, accelerating ray tracing, n-body simulation algorithms (fast-multipole-method, Barnes-Hut), two-point correlation etc.

I obtained my B.Tech degree from [B.M.S. College of Engineering, Bangalore](http://bmsce.in/) in 2002, and M.Tech degree from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in 2005, both in Computer Science and Engineering.
After my masters degree, I spent over 8 years in engineering positions in leading semiconductor companies gaining a rich experience developing hardware, middleware, and application layer software for communication chips (GPS, WLAN, DVB) used in mobile devices. I also had a great experience working for a startup developing apps, and algorithms for making mobile advertising effective.
