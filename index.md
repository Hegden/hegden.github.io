## About me
I am currently a graduate student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) and my advisor is [Prof. Milind Kulkarni](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/).

My interests lie in the broad areas of Distributed and Parallel Programming Frameworks, Programming Languages, and Scientific Computing. Specifically, I am interested in automating the creation of, and optimizing distributed implementations of irregular, tree-based algorithms. Examples of such algorithms are: finding nearest neighbors, mining frequent items in a transaction set, accelerating ray tracing, n-body simulation algorithms (fast-multipole-method, Barnes-Hut), two-point correlation etc.



### Current Projects
 
- [Treelogy](https://bitbucket.org/plcl/treelogy)  -  A Benchmark Suite and an Ontology for Tree Traversal Algorithms.
- [SPIRIT](https://bitbucket.org/plcl/treelogy) - A framework for creating distributed recursive tree applications. The source code is available under the DM folder of Treelogy sourcecode.
- HSSEigen: Parallelizing and distributed-memory implementation of super-fast eigen solvers for HSS matrices.

### Past Projects
- [Hybrid CPU-GPU scheduling and execution of tree traversals](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2851174) - Scheduling optimization for tree traversal algorithms executing on GPUs.
- WaSP -  Ensemble-based, Warm-Starting Parameter Initialization for Training of Deep Neural Network Models.
