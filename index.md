## About me
I am currently a graduate student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) and my advisor is [Prof. Milind Kulkarni](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/).

My interests lie in the broad areas of Distributed and Parallel Programming Frameworks, Programming Languages, and Scientific Computing. Specifically, I am interested in automating the creation of, and optimizing distributed implementations of irregular, tree-based algorithms. Examples of such algorithms are: finding nearest neighbors, mining frequent items in a transaction set, accelerating ray tracing, n-body simulation algorithms (fast-multipole-method, Barnes-Hut), two-point correlation etc.
