        		<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p>I am currently a graduate student in the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE">School of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Purdue University and my advisor is <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/">Prof. Milind Kulkarni</a>.
			<br />
			<br />
My interests lie in the broad areas of Distributed and Parallel Programming Frameworks, Programming Languages, and Scientific Computing. Specifically, I am interested in automating the creation of, and optimizing distributed implementations of irregular algorithms. Examples of such algorithms are: finding nearest neighbors, mining frequent items in a transaction set, accelerating ray tracing, n-body simulation algorithms (fast-multipole-method, Barnes-Hut), two-point correlation etc.
<br />
<br />
I obtained my B.Tech degree from <a href="http://bmsce.in/">B.M.S. College of Engineering, Bangalore</a> in 2002, and M.Tech degree from <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Madras</a> in 2005, both in Computer Science and Engineering. After my masters degree, I spent over 8 years in engineering positions in leading semiconductor companies gaining a rich experience developing hardware, middleware, and application layer software for communication chips (GPS, WLAN, DVB) used in mobile devices. I also had a great experience working for a startup developing apps, and algorithms for making mobile advertising effective.</p>
