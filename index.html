        		<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p>I am currently a graduate student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at Purdue University and my advisor is [Prof. Milind Kulkarni](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/).
			<br />
My interests lie in the broad areas of Distributed and Parallel Programming Frameworks, Programming Languages, and Scientific Computing. Specifically, I am interested in automating the creation of, and optimizing distributed implementations of irregular algorithms. Examples of such algorithms are: finding nearest neighbors, mining frequent items in a transaction set, accelerating ray tracing, n-body simulation algorithms (fast-multipole-method, Barnes-Hut), two-point correlation etc.
<br />
I obtained my B.Tech degree from [B.M.S. College of Engineering, Bangalore](http://bmsce.in/) in 2002, and M.Tech degree from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2005](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), both in Computer Science and Engineering. After my masters degree, I spent over 8 years in engineering positions in leading semiconductor companies gaining a rich experience developing hardware, middleware, and application layer software for communication chips (GPS, WLAN, DVB) used in mobile devices. I also had a great experience working for a startup developing apps, and algorithms for making mobile advertising effective.</p>
