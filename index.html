        		<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p>I am currently a graduate student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University and my advisor is Prof. Milind Kulkarni.

My interests lie in the broad areas of Distributed and Parallel Programming Frameworks, Programming Languages, and Scientific Computing. Specifically, I am interested in automating the creation of, and optimizing distributed implementations of irregular algorithms. Examples of such algorithms are: finding nearest neighbors, mining frequent items in a transaction set, accelerating ray tracing, n-body simulation algorithms (fast-multipole-method, Barnes-Hut), two-point correlation etc.

I obtained my B.Tech degree from B.M.S. College of Engineering, Bangalore in 2002, and M.Tech degree from Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2005, both in Computer Science and Engineering. After my masters degree, I spent over 8 years in engineering positions in leading semiconductor companies gaining a rich experience developing hardware, middleware, and application layer software for communication chips (GPS, WLAN, DVB) used in mobile devices. I also had a great experience working for a startup developing apps, and algorithms for making mobile advertising effective.</a></p>
