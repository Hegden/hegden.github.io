				<p>I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE">School of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Purdue University and my advisor is <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/">Prof. Milind Kulkarni</a>.</p>

<p>My interests lie in the areas of Parallel and Distributed computing, and Programming Languages. Specifically, I am interested in developing abstractions and systems necessary to create parallel programs that are efficient and are easy to implement for an average programmer. Currently, I focus on automating the creation of, and optimizing distributed implementations of irregular algorithms. Well-known examples of such algorithms are: finding nearest neighbors, mining frequent items in a transaction set, accelerating ray tracing, n-body simulation algorithms (fast-multipole-method, Barnes-Hut), two-point correlation etc.</p>

<p>I obtained my master's degree from <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a> in 2005, and bachelor's degree from <a href="http://bmsce.in/">B. M. S. College of Engineering, Bangalore</a> in 2002, both in Computer Science and Engineering. I also have over eight years of professional experience working in the industry developing hardware, middleware, and software for mobile platforms. In the past, I worked for Intel, Nokia, ST Microelectronics, and AdsFLO, a start-up that delivered mobile advertising solutions. Here is my detailed <a href="/NikhilHegde_CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
