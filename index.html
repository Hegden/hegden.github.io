				<p>I am currently a graduate student in the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE">School of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Purdue University and my advisor is <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/">Prof. Milind Kulkarni</a>.</p>

<p>My interests lie in the areas of Parallel and Distributed computing, and Programming Languages. Specifically, I am interested in developing abstractions and systems necessary to create performance-oriented programs and yet, are easy to implement for an average programmer. Currently, I focus on automating the creation of, and optimizing distributed implementations of irregular algorithms. Examples of such algorithms are: finding nearest neighbors, mining frequent items in a transaction set, accelerating ray tracing, n-body simulation algorithms (fast-multipole-method, Barnes-Hut), two-point correlation etc.</p>

<p>I obtained my B.Tech degree from <a href="http://bmsce.in/">B.M.S. College of Engineering, Bangalore</a> in 2002, and M.Tech degree from <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Madras</a> in 2005, both in Computer Science and Engineering. After my master's degree, I spent over 8 years in engineering positions in leading semiconductor companies developing hardware, middleware, and application layer software for communication chips (GPS, WLAN, DVB) used in mobile devices. I also had a great experience working for a startup developing apps, and algorithms for making mobile advertising effective. Here is my detailed <a href="/NikhilHegde_CV.pdf">CV</a></p>
