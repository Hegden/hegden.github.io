<h3>Description:</h3> <p>This course focuses on the principles of compiler design and implementation. Topics include:
<ul>
<li>Scanning and parsing: determining the syntactic structure of a program </li>
<li>Semantic routines: determining the semantics of a program and building intermediate representation</li>
<li>Code generation: emitting equivalent assembly code for the program</li>
<li>Optimizations: improving the performance of a program</li>
<li>Program analysis: determining interesting information about program's behavior</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Details:</h3> 
The course <a href="syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> discusses most of the details of the course, including a tentative schedule of topics, exam dates, and other administrative information. Announcements, assignment links, and grades will be posted on <a href="https://moodle2.iitdh.ac.in/">Moodle</a>. We will be using <a href="https://piazza.com/iitdh.ac.in/spring2020/cs406/">Piazza</a> for online discussion of the lectures and assignments. If you have a question about a concept covered in lecture or about a detail of an assignment, check Piazza first!
