<h3>Description:</h3> <p>This course focuses on the principles and practice of programming in C. We will cover the topics needed to become knowledgable C programmers, and concepts that can be transferred to many other languages. Topics include:
<ul>
<li>Tools for programming (Git, GDB, and make) </li>
<li>Data types and structures</li>
<li>Pointers and memory allocation</li>
<li>Recursion</li>
<li>Dynamic data structures (linked lists and trees)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Details:</h3> 
The course <a href="syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> discusses most of the details of the course, including a tentative schedule of topics, exam dates, and other administrative information. Assignment links will be distributed via Blackboard announcements and emails, and grades will be posted on <a href="https://mycourses.purdue.edu/">Blackboard</a>. We will be using <a href="https://piazza.com/purdue/summer2019/ece26400/">Piazza</a> for online discussion of the lectures and assignments. If you have a question about a concept covered in lecture or about a detail of an assignment, check Piazza first!
